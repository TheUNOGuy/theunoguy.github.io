# My programming Adventure

It all started when I started learning ms dos in 5th grade, I found it real intresting and in 6th I learnt html, and finally in 8th I learned C++ ( Also with the help of my father )! The basics only of course. So my father taught and I explored the world of C++...Well that changed. Due to COVID-19, I was at home and I found another programming language - Python. So that was the start. After about 5 - 6 months of learning and practicing, I wanted to make GUI applications. Well that's when I discovered wxpython. I started with the ambition of making a file explorer but then I later realized that was too hard and I'll start with something easy. Then I knew a text editor would be the best and there's where TakeNotes arose. I plan to make more applictaions and release updates for the current ones in GitHub!

# With GitHub

Well I wanted to publish my apps somewhere and well there were a few places; But I thought GitHub would be the most ideal place. A great place to control everything with git and you can handle releases, manage code branches, issue management, and even have a small community forum ( Discussions )! Well I headed straight towards that path.

# TakeNotes

Well TakeNotes was not TakeNotes at first. My plans switched from a file explorer to a youtube developer app, and more...Also, I wanted to name it 'Notebook' at first but later on I told myself, no that's not a good name. So I kept thinking, 'TakePad'...no. that's not great, 'TakeDown'..no. again...So, I settled on 'TakeNotes'; I thought it was a good name :) And a perfect GUI library would be required for this. So I browsed some libraries like 'Tkinter'. Tkinter, I thought was too restricted and I needed a flexible library. So I selected the 'wx' library or known as 'wxpython'...I started developing the app..Encountered a few problems ( obviously stack overflow ) and I started releasing versions and I still do to this day! I want to excel Notepad in every way with different and better features!! Though I think TakeNotes v2.0 will be the last version developed...
