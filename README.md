# My programming Adventure

It all started when I started learning ms dos in 5th grade, I found it real intresting and in 6th I learnt html, and finally in 8th I learned C++ ( Also with the help of my father )! The basics only of course. So my father taught and I explored the world of C++...Well that changed. Due to COVID-19, I was at home and I found another programming language - Python. So that was the start. After about 5 - 6 months of learning and practicing, I wanted to make GUI applications. Well that's when I discovered wxpython. I started with the ambition of making a file explorer but then I later realized that was too hard and I'll start with something easy. Then I knew a text editor would be the best and there's where TakeNotes arose. I plan to make more applictaions and release updates for the current ones in GitHub!
